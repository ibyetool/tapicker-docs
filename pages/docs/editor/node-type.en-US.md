# Node Type

Currently, we provide 13 nodes for you to freely combine to meet data scraping in various scenarios.

<Image src="/screenshots/node-type.png" alt="node-type" />

### Open Page

Open the start page where you want to scrape data, usually we put this node first.

<Image src="/screenshots/node-open-page.png" alt="node-open-page" />

parameter settings:

- "Data source" means where to get the page link?
  - from manual entry - fixed, no longer changes once filled.
  - from user input - variable, user-defined page link.
  - from loop input - variable, page links are automatically entered by the loop node.
- "Page Link" needs to fill in the page link, you can fill in the current page link with one click of the button on the left.
- "Timeout" means that if the page is not opened after more than 20 seconds, the task will end.

### Enter Loop

The "enter loop" node can do some repetitive work, and we put the node that needs to be repeated in this node.

<Image src="/screenshots/node-enter-loop-example.png" alt="node-enter-loop-example" width="auto" height="80%" />

Like this, it means that these nodes need to be executed repeatedly.

<Image src="/screenshots/node-enter-loop.png" alt="node-enter-loop" width="auto" height="80%" />

parameter settings:

- "Cycle Name" is automatically generated by the system and you can modify it freely.
- "Cycle Type"
  - Link List - Cycle by the number of links, such as: batch crawl detail pages.
  - Text List - Cycle by the number of texts, for example: batch search keywords.
  - number of loops - repeat n times
  - Load times - load n times, for example: automatic page turning
- "Data Sources"
  - from manual entry - fixed, no longer changes once filled.
  - from user input - variable, user defined input. For example: it is up to the user to decide how many pages of data to crawl.

### Scroll Page

There are some websites that do lazy loading of images and need to scroll the page before the images are loaded.
This node is important if you need to scrape image links.

<Image src="/screenshots/node-scroll-page.png" alt="node-scroll-page" />

parameter settings:

- "Rolling Type"
  - Scroll to the bottom of the page - fits most scenarios
  - Scroll to element position - eg: scroll to pagination position
  - scroll to specified position - 1000 - means scroll down 1000px
  - scroll to the current position and then scroll
- "Target Element" html - Indicates scrolling of the entire page, you can customize scrolling elements to meet partial scrolling.
- "Scroll step length" indicates the distance of each scroll
- "Interval time" indicates the interval time of each scroll
- "Offset" supports positive and negative values. For example: scroll to a position of 1000px and set the offset to -200px, then the final scroll distance is 800px.

Scrolling the page may be time-consuming. You can choose whether to disable the "Scroll Page" node to improve the collection speed according to the actual situation.
</Callout>

### Extract Data

This is a very important node that tells DataPicker how to extract data from the page?

<Image src="/screenshots/node-extract-data.png" alt="node-extract-data" />

parameter settings:

- "Table Name" is automatically generated by the system and you can freely modify it.
- If "Dump" is not checked, the captured data will not be stored, but can be provided to other nodes for reference.

**Config Table Rows**

The row selector is necessary. When extracting the details page data, the entire page can be regarded as a row, and it can be filled in as "body".

<Image src="/screenshots/node-extract-data-table-rows.png" alt="node-extract-data-table-rows" width="80%" />

parameter settings:

- "Target Element" sets the CSS selector of the target element of the list, which can be set quickly through [Advanced Finder@todo](/zh-CN/todo)
- "Filter" can filter out unwanted rows, such as ads.
- When "End task if no line is found" is unchecked, it can be used to extract optional data.

**Config Table Cols**

<Image src="/screenshots/node-extract-data-col-editor.png" alt="node-extract-data-col-editor" width="80%" />

parameter settings:

- "Column Type"
  - Extract from row - Indicates that the data to be extracted is within the area of the selected row
  - Extract from outside row - Indicates that the data to be extracted is outside the area of the selected row
  - extract from self - Indicates that data is to be extracted from the selected row itself
  - Extract from loop - Indicates that data is to be referenced from loop information, eg: index number, current value, etc.
  - Extracted from the system - Some basic fields can be referenced, such as: page link, page title, current time, etc.
- "Target Element" sets the CSS selector of the column target element, which can be set quickly through [Advanced Finder@todo](/zh-CN/todo).
- "Extract Attribute" is usually recommended automatically after you select the target element.
- "Default value" When no data can be extracted, use the default value.

**Management Table Cols**

Here supports `sort`, `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `preview`, `trim` and other operations on columns.
