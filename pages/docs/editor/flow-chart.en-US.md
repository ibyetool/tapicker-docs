# Flow Chart

A recipe is a grouping of nodes, a flowchart describing the process of how to extract data from a page.
We can quickly adjust the node order by dragging and dropping. Nodes can also be added, deleted, and edited here.

Note: After the node is changed, it will not be automatically saved. When you need to save, please manually click the "Save" button.
