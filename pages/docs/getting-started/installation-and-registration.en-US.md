# Installaton and Registration

## How to install?

DataPicker has been released to the Google and Microsoft app stores and has passed the review. It is safe and reliable. You can install it directly in the app store with one click:

- Install in Chrome browser: [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tapicker/baglkjackdnhdpjjcjpkhmemggiklhid)
- Install in Edge browser: [Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tapicker/ejmegoaahjcedhklldmdmmgbjoioifje)

Inconsistent review times across app stores can result in different releases across browsers. Usually the version review speed on Chrome is faster, it is recommended that you install the latest version.
