# Recipes Panel

When you open the extension, it will focus on this panel by default, where you can use recipes or manage your own recipes.

Basic queries are provided here so that you can quickly find the target recipe:

1. Retrieve
2. Filter
3. Sort

### Retrieve

Currently, fuzzy search for recipe names is supported, for example: searching for the keyword "phone" will find recipes that contain "phone" in the name.

### Filter

You can filter the recipes available for the current domain, like this: Filter recipes that work on Shopbop.com.

Domain names that appear as `*` indicate that the recipe will work on any website.
